The flaw arises from trusting attacker-controlled values when parsing HTTP responses, enabling an attacker to craft malicious HTTP requests that result in an out-of-bounds write primitive. This vulnerability is exploitable during the early boot phase, requiring the attacker to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack or compromise the boot server. Impact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete system compromise, including bypassing Secure Boot mechanisms. AdditionalInformation: This vulnerability affects Shim versions less than 15.8-1 and shim-unsigned-x64 versions less than 15.8-5. It is critical during the early boot phase and requires specific conditions for exploitation, such as network interception or server compromise. Remediation: Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors.
